                                You should prep your private advertisement efforts before launching your campaign
                                and let everyone know that it is about to launch. After it does launch, you should consider
                                advertising in many ways such as:
                                Launching ad campaigns on many social media sites, apps and search engine pages.
                                Using social media accounts to share your campaign and ask others to share it too. Also
                                create a hashtag and Facebook Event for your campaign. And post many creative and
                                catchy updates on all social media sites. Be sure to use the link generator from your
                                campaign’s page!
                                Contact your local media with a story about your campaign, if it would be appropriate or
                                of interest to your local community. Some campaigns would lend themselves well to
                                national or even international media. Be sure to consider them all, newspapers, TV news
                                channels, radio, podcasts, blogs and vlogs!
                                Obtain endorsement from influencers, celebrities, industry experts or athletes etc. to
                                spread the awareness of your campaign in a positive way.
                                Set up a local community event to bring awareness to your campaign.
                                Place links, videos, images and posters everywhere to gain attention. Place them on
                                different posting sites, forums and brick and mortar locations too.
                                Hopefully you have been building an email list already, now is your time to use it and let
                                everyone know. Reach out to people who may be interested such as friends, acquaintances,
                                people from your past, family, followers and fans. Or consider purchasing email lists or
                                mailing lists of people who may be interested in funding your campaign.
                                Be creative and think creative. Pull a safe and unique publicity stunt to attract attention to
                                your campaign. Just be sure to make sure that it can’t cause any undesirable or unforeseen
                                negative backlash and that it is legal. Think ahead and have fun with it!

                                For a comprehensive rundown on how this works, keep reading. This pot will
                                automatically add money to fund seeker’s listings which are almost near their goals for
                                funding. When the pot is between $0.01 - $49.99 it will automatically add the entire pot’s
                                amount to the next listing which is within its final hour of being active, if it is $50 or less
                                away from reaching its goal. <br>
                                When the pot is between $50 - $3,999.99 it will automatically add $50 from its total to
                                every listing which is within its final hour of being active, if they are $50 or less away from
                                reaching their goal. <br>
                                When the pot is between $4,000 – 7,999.99, it will automatically add $100 from its total
                                to every listing which is within its final hour of being active, if they are $100 or less away
                                from reaching their goal. <br>
                                When the pot is at $8,000 or more, it will automatically add $200 from its total to every
                                listing which is within its final hour of being active, if they are $200 or less away from
                                reaching their goal. <br>
                                If the pot reaches $0.00 it will remain inactive until it is funded. We recommend for people
                                to donate whatever they can to help everyone in the community. Look at it as a tip jar that
                                helps the world!

                                Absolutely! The % is only based upon each campaign’s initial goal which is the least
                                they require to accomplish their described barebones task. With additional funding, you
                                can make things bigger and better! Stretch goals are often outlined in each campaign to
                                show what they can accomplish with even more funding. By helping a campaign over
                                exceed its lowest base goal, makes for much greater success in the long run

                                models. Big Business is for large company campaigns. Rewards are for campaigns which
                                offer rewards but you will not receive the funds if the goal is not met. Quick Cash Injection
                                is for campaigns which offer rewards but these projects can keep the funding raised even if
                                the goal is not met. Donation is for causes which typically offer no rewards. Urgent Need is
                                for campaigns which require emergency funding. And Long Term Support is for long-term
                                and ongoing donation support.

                                We offer a unique 4 round system and each round works a little differently.
                                The initial Round is when your campaign first launches.
                                Round 2 lets you re-launch your project if you didn't get enough funding for it or if you
                                want to go for even more funding to reach for higher stretch goals.
                                Round 3 only lets you re-launch your project if you didn't reach your goal yet through
                                Round 2.
                                And lastly is, Overtime. This only allows you to re-launch your project for one last, fixed 30
                                hour attempt and only if you still didn't reach your round 2 goal yet from Round 3.

                                plan to run. Campaigns which want to make a product work best with rewards. Campaigns
                                which need help with things such as tragedies, work best without rewards. But there are
                                always exceptions such as a product or service which have dedicated fans. These types can
                                sometimes successfully fund without a reward and simply because people believe in the
                                project itself.

                                The campaign owner is responsible for these issues. Nearly all campaign owners are
                                responsible and diligent to comply bring their campaign’s goal to fruition. Some
                                campaigns can be delayed due to unforeseen events or overambitious timelines, especially
                                those involving coding, manufacturing and product development. They are working hard
                                to fulfill each reward order and satisfy their supporters. However, occasionally something
                                goes wrong and a campaign owner must be held solely accountable for this. If a certain
                                campaign does not deliver what it promises or it becomes responsible for a product,
                                action or service which causes any harm, the campaign’s owner is legally held responsible
                                for this. Legal suit can be brought against them and or their company / organization and
                                additional complaints can be filed via the BBB. But we first ask you to try to work this
                                situation out by communicating with them to resolve any issues in a constructive manner.

                                $100 - $100,000,000,000,000. However, it is best to be optimistically realistic with your
                                goal. Asking for just $100 will likely not accomplish much while asking for an unrealistic
                                sum may discourage some individuals from funding your campaign. Know how much
                                would be appropriate to ask for within the context of what you are aiming to achieve.
