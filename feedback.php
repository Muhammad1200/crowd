If he had been there, he would have enjoyed it as it was fun and competitive too. Seeing everyone with t-shirts with his name on them was a nice touch but also tinged with sadness as it hit us how sorely he is missed and without him everything has changed. The trophy presentation and your speech at the end was touching and it ended the event perfectly. MashAllah."
