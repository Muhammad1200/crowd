                        <p> Muhammed Jawaad Abdul Quyyum a son, brother, twin, husband, father, grandson, nephew, uncle and a friend to many.
                        </p>
                        <p>You lived a simple life made many people laugh and always had a joke to tell. You are loved by many and your memories will be cherished for ever in our hearts.
                        </p>
                        <p>21st July 2015 was a sad day. A day we laid to rest an important part of our lives. There hasn't been a day that has gone by that you have not been in our thoughts or duas.
                        </p>
                        <p>There hasn't been a moment in my life that I wish I could have one more moment with you to let you know that I love you bro.
                        </p>
                        <p>Arranging this tournament in your memory reminded me of the times we played football, both of us on the same side, beating opponents. You up front and me in defense that was all that we needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Those who had the privilege to play alongside you know what great player you were; watching you take on the whole team and finishing with style.
                        </p>
                        <p>Friends and family made 31st August 2015 a special day in your memory with the inaugural MJAQ Tournament.
                        </p>
                        <p>I was overwhelmed by the love and generosity that they all showed, with calls to make this an annual tournament even before the day ended.
                        </p>
                        <p>All the money raised was donated to charity in your memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>We raised £2,500 on the day and have received donations throughout the year. In total we managed to raise £5,000, which we donated to Al Khair Foundation, in order to build a small masjid on behalf of Muhammed Jawaad Abdul Quyyum.
